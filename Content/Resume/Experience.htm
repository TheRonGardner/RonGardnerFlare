        <p><span class="span_5">FinThrive, Inc. (formerly nThrive)</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_5">Plano, TX</p>
        <p class="p_6"><span class="span_6">Lead Technical Writer, January 2018—April 2023</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_7">Daily Responsibilities</p>
        <p class="p_6"><span class="span_7">Supervised a team of 5 experienced technical writers. Trained the team to use MadCap Flare to update existing online help and release notes from “tri-pane” CHM help files to “side navigation” and then more dynamic “top navigation” HTML help files. Assisted team members with daily writing chores and mentored each team member when needed. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_6"><span class="span_7">Used Microsoft Team Foundation Server/Azure DevOps/Jira to track new features, updates to products, and bugs requiring documentation. Used TortoiseGit as source control tool for Flare source files and HTML output.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_8"><span class="span_7">Designed end-user documentation in an Agile environment for multiple products, each of which had multiple development teams. Attended daily scrum meetings, planning meetings, iteration/sprint out demos, and refinement meetings. Interviewed Project Management, Development, and QA SMEs to gather information necessary to document new, updated, or deprecated features. Used MadCap Flare to write, edit, publish, and maintain HTML-based release notes and online help (for both clients and internal personnel) for multiple healthcare applications. </span>
        </p>
        <p class="p_9">Met weekly with upper management to:</p>
        <ul class="ul_3">
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_10">Develop plans to allocate team resources</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_10">Discuss ways to innovate the look and feel of online documentation</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_1">
                <p class="p_10">Set quarterly team goals</p>

                <p class="p_11"><span class="span_8">Major Accomplishments</span>
                </p>
                <p class="p_12"><span class="span_7">Guided transition to a shared Flare global project, which allowed the team to import commonly used content (topics, images, style sheets, master pages, snippets, variables, etc.) from the global project into multiple child projects. This established a consistent look and feel across multiple sets of documentation maintained by multiple users.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="p_12"><span class="span_7">Implemented a system of maintaining one Flare project per application, which greatly reduced the time needed for the team to generate and maintain multiple output types in each application. Previously, there were multiple Flare projects for the various output types (e.g., one Flare project for online help, one for release notes, etc.)</span>
                </p>
                <p class="p_12"><span class="span_7">Implemented micro content and “mini videos” into online help, which allowed users to quickly visualize and understand complex procedures. This helped greatly reduce training time for new employees or existing employees who needed “refresher” lessons.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="p_12"><span class="span_7">Presented at corporate “Tech Day” event. My team’s presentation laid out a business plan for implementing interactive walk-throughs atop existing application user interfaces. This would greatly reduce the time necessary to train new users or retrain existing users. </span>

                <p class="p_12"><span class="span_7">Interviewed Development, QA, Marketing, and Sales SMEs to gather information necessary to document new or updated features.

                </p>
                <p class="p_12"><span class="span_7">Guided documentation team’s transition from Adobe FrameMaker to MadCap Flare (converted primary output of deliverables from PDF to HTML) and planned the layout for a new HTML-based documentation portal. Designed, wrote, and maintained installation, administration, XML configuration reference, end-user, and API reference product documentation for multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, and IBM z/OS).

                </p>
                <p class="p_12"><span class="span_7">Helped establish an in-house training curriculum (“Systemware University”). Designed and maintained online training courses through MadCap Flare. Worked with customers to create, deliver, and maintain online training simulations.</span>

                <p class="p_12"><span class="span_7">Transition to HTML-based documentation greatly reduced the time needed to access extremely complicated information. This gave Systemware support personnel more time to focus on critical client issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="p_12"><span class="span_7">“Systemware University” helped prepare new employees for future job responsibilities. This greatly reduced the time SMEs needed to spend training new personnel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="p_12"><span class="span_7">Application test beds I created and maintained severely reduced the time required for the documentation team to research and write about new features and updates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="p_12"><span class="span_7">Transition from using the company file network to a Git repository allowed the documentation team to utilize drastically improved version control measures.</span>
