            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ah, yes. Franklin Barbecue. The "Holy Grail" of Texas barbecue joints. My wife and I went to&#160;Franklin on a whim during a trip to the Austin area in the summer of 2013. We knew there would be a long, long, loooooong line, so we arrived at 8:45 AM, a full two-plus hours before it opened. There were already about 40 people in line.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">
                <img src="../Resources/Images/FranklinLine.png" class="popup" title="[%=General.ImageTip%]" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { max-width: 40%; }" />
            </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">That is dedication! As you can see, they all brought chairs and books to pass the time. My wife and I thought ahead and brought our own folding beach chairs so we could sit during the multi-hour wait. They helped a ton!</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">About an hour before opening, someone from Franklin walked down the line, asking what and how much each person/party planned to order. The Franklin rep  then estimated a point where the meat would run out and handed the person at that spot in the line a cardboard sign. Anyone in line behind the sign is out of luck for that day. C'est la vie! </p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Recommends</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">I&#160;had the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term7">moist brisket</MadCap:glossaryTerm> and <span class="FoodName">pork spareribs</span>. I&#160;recall both being rather tasty, especially the brisket. Franklin has some interesting choices in sauces as well:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic"> The usual tomato-based sauce that's prevalent throughout Texas.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">A vinegar-based sauce that's more common in the Carolinas.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic"> An espresso-based sauce that has a distinct coffee flavor that pairs well with smoked meat.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">All three sauces were very good and are available at most major Texas grocery stores or online.</p>

            <p>No debate on my end that the food at Franklin was good, and I enjoyed it very much. I'll give it four stars, but I don't get the <span class="FoodName">INSANE</span>&#160;hype around this place. I've done the three-plus-hour wait (four, actually, because there was another hour in line after we got inside the place).&#160;I&#160;don't need to jump through those hoops again, although we did have a celebrity sighting while waiting in line:&#160;<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0655585/" target="_blank" title="Click this link to open his IMDB page.">Jared Padalecki</a>, one of the stars of the TV&#160;show "Supernatural",&#160;was there with his family. I&#160;left him alone, of course. Dude just wanted a quiet meal with his family.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">So, in closing, let me put it this way about Franklin&#160;Barbecue:&#160;good food but... "Been there, done that, got the t-shirt". </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Quite literally:</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">
                <img src="../Resources/Images/Franklin Tshirt.png" class="popup" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { height: 50%; }" title="[%=General.ImageTip%]" />
            </p>
        </MadCap:microContent>
        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">I&#160;cannot stress this enough... the lines that form at Franklin are <em>nuts</em> and they form <em>early</em>. Get there several hours before it opens and bring a folding beach chair or rent one from the guy across the street. He charges $5 a pop, although he might have raised his prices since I visited.</p>
