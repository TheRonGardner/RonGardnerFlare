            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Besides Franklin Barbecue, The Salt Lick is probably one of the most famous barbecue joints in Texas. It's in an out-of-the-way location southwest of Austin, but it's totally worth the drive. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">If you arrive later in the day, there can be pretty long lines to get in the door, so you might want to come early. However, if you <em>do</em> have to wait, there's usually something going on outside to pass the time, such as local musicians playing for the assembled crowd. Or you can just strike up a conversation with a nearby stranger and chat about other barbecue joints you've visited, which is a subject any true "'cue aficionado" would approach with abandon.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">The Salt Lick serves food on three-sectioned plastic green plates. </p>

            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">My wife has a saying about them:</p>
            <div MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic" class="indent"><em>"Those little green plates make me happy!"</em>
            </div>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">I&#160;wholly agree. A trip to the Salt Lick always makes me happy!</p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron's Review</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">The Salt Lick is well-known for its "<span class="FoodName">Family Style</span>" option, which is an all-you-can-eat meats-travaganza including the following:</p>
            <ul MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">
                <li>
                    <p><span class="FoodName">Brisket</span> (you can ask for either lean or <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term7">moist</MadCap:glossaryTerm> or <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term1">burnt ends</MadCap:glossaryTerm>)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="FoodName">Pork ribs</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="FoodName">Pork sausage</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="FoodName">Potato salad</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="FoodName">Pinto beans</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="FoodName">Cole Slaw</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="FoodName">"Fixings"</span> such as bread, pickles, jalapenos, and onions</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

                <img src="../Resources/Images/SaltLickFamilyStyle.JPG" style="mc-thumbnail: popup;" />
            </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">A bit of advice... ask for a second round after you get through the first, even if you're stuffed to the gills and can't eat another bite. You can take the second round to go; the wait staff will happily give you to-go containers. They're pretty cool about that at The Salt Lick.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">If you order the Family Style meal and aren't worried about the extra strain on your belt, also order the <span class="FoodName">beef rib</span>. This thing is freaking HUGE!  It looks like something that would have flipped over the Flintstone's car. I&#160;mean, look at that thing!!!</p>

                <img src="../Resources/Images/SaltLickBeefRib.png" class="popup" title="[%=General.ImageTip%]" />
            </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">One final suggestion... if - <em>somehow</em> - you have room for dessert after all that, go for the <span class="FoodName">blackberry cobbler ala mode</span>. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but it is one of my favorite desserts. Ever. I don't know what The Salt Lick does with the base of the cobbler, but it seems to be some kind of sweet, cake-like cornbread supporting a thick, delicious blackberry compote. Add a scoop of vanilla <a href="https://www.bluebell.com/" target="_blank">Blue Bell</a> ice cream, and it's pure bliss! </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Let me put it this way... I don't have any pictures of the cobbler  because I pounce on it every time it's set down in front of me.</p>

            <p>My wife and I love The Salt Lick so much we had it cater our 2007 wedding in the nearby town of <a href="http://visitwimberley.com/" target="_blank" title="Click this link to open the &quot;Visit Wimberley&quot; website.">Wimberley</a>.&#160;We REALLY love this place and make a point to go there every time we vacation in the area. Coming or going (and sometimes both), we ALWAYS&#160;fit in at least one trip to The Salt Lick!</p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">  This is a cash-only joint, so make sure you have some bills on hand before you set foot in there. If you don't, there is an on-site ATM. However, be prepared to pay some serious fees to get that cash.</p>
