        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Hey there!&#160;Hope you're ready for my little tour of my favorite Central Texas barbecue joints!</p>
        <p>I'm a born and raised Texan who spent his formative years in Central Texas, which spans -  depending upon whom you ask - the following points of the compass:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillsboro,_Texas" target="_blank" title="Click this link to view the Wikipedia page for Hillsboro.">Hillsboro</a> to the north</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan–College_Station" target="_blank" title="Click this link to view the Wikipedia page for Bryan/College Station">Bryan/College Station</a> (aka "Aggieland"; where I&#160;went to <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">college</a>) to the east</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Braunfels,_Texas" target="_blank" title="Click this link to open the Wikipedia page for New Braunfels.">New Braunfels</a> (where I&#160;went to <a href="https://chs.comalisd.org/" target="_blank">high school</a>)&#160;to the south</li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Saba,_Texas" target="_blank" title="Click this link to open the Wikipedia page for San Saba.">San Saba</a> to the west</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">These points are pulled from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Texas" target="_blank" title="Click this link to open the Wikipedia page for Central Texas.">Wikipedia definition of Central Texas</a>, although sentimental reasons made me alter its definition of the southern border to include my hometown of New Braunfels, which is the next town due south from San Marcos.</p>
        <p>As part of this Flare certification project, I created a more expansive HTML version of this guide. That version includes the barbecue joints I've visited across the <em>entire</em> state of Texas. This PDF&#160;document focuses on the region that's closest to my heart, a region that is replete with amazing barbecue and even more amazing scenery.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Whenever I'm in Central Texas, I try to visit as many barbecue joints as I can, from Belton to Austin to Driftwood and points beyond. Before COVID, I visited the area at least every other year. Post COVID, it will be my mission to get back down there and continue my quest!</p>
