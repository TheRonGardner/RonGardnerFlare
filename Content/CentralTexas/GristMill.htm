            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">This scenic restaurant located in Gruene (pronounced "green") is just shy of an hour's drive north of downtown San Antonio, depending how kind the traffic is on I-35 that day. It isn't <em>technically</em> a barbecue joint, but it is one of my favorite restaurants on the planet. It was once literally a grist mill that ground the town's grain into flour. During the mid-70s, it was converted to a multi-level dining experience with both indoor and outdoor seating with great views of the Guadalupe River below.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">If you've read my review of <a href="SaltLick.htm#Salt">The Salt Lick</a>, you know I got married in the nearby town of <a href="http://visitwimberley.com/" target="_blank" title="Click this link to open the &quot;Visit Wimberley&quot; website.">Wimberley</a>. When it came time to decide on a place for our rehearsal dinner, Grist Mill was an EASY&#160;choice!</p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Recommends</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Why did I include Grist Mill on my list of favorite Texas barbecue places, even though it's not a barbecue restaurant?&#160;For one thing and one thing alone: </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Those. Amazing. <span class="FoodName">Baby. Back. Ribs.</span> </p>

            </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">They offer a half rack and a full rack. The pic above shows the half rack, which is still <em>plenty</em> of food.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Everything on Grist Mill's menu is absolutely fantastic, but every time I go there, I must must MUST get those ribs and a side of pinto beans.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">I don't know what the cooks at Grist Mill do, but those ribs are always spot on. The bones just slide right out, giving less messy access to that tender pork. The barbecue sauce coating the ribs is smoky, tangy, sweet perfection. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic,Default.WebOnly">The smile on my face in the following pic should tell you all you need to know!</p>

            </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic,Default.WebOnly">If you look closely, you can see I&#160;went for the full rack during that visit. What can I say... it was my birthday, and I&#160;was going for it all!&#160;</p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Rates It</h2>

            </p>
            <p>For the food alone, I'd give Grist Mill my full 5-star rating. However, the scenic outdoor seating takes this place to an even higher level. Definitely a solid 5 stars!!!</p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">    Ask for an outside table, weather permitting. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="Default.WebOnly">It is totally worth it, if only to watch people <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term13">toobing</MadCap:glossaryTerm> by below on the Guadalupe River. The weather in Gruene is pretty pleasant throughout the year, so an outside table is almost always a safe bet.</MadCap:conditionalText></p>
