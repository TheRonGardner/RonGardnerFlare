            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">These are just a few of the accolades heaped on this "Tex-Mex barbecue" joint located on the southeast side of San Antonio. All this is definitely well-deserved praise. However, I think the phrase that best describes this place is prominently displayed on the front of the building:</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic"><em>Barbecue con ganas</em>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">My Spanish is a tad rusty, but I believe it roughly translates to "barbecue with passion". That's not an exaggeration on their part. You can tell the people at 2M&#160;really love what they do and create some fantastic barbecue with a slightly different twist.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">My wife and I visited here on a whim during a trip to San Antonio on a late summer Saturday afternoon in 2019. Some of the items we wanted to try were sold out (definitely a good sign we're somewhere worthwhile), but that didn't bother us at all. It's part of the gamble when you arrive at a well-known Texas barbecue joint later in the day. </p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Recommends</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">I went with the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term7">moist brisket</MadCap:glossaryTerm>, which was smoky, tender, and fatty in the best, most delicious way. I&#160;wanted to try the sausage made with pork, poblano chiles, and Oxaca cheese, which sounded amazing, but they were sold out that day. Undaunted, I&#160;opted for the <span class="FoodName">beef sausage</span>.  I'm not usually a fan of all-beef sausage, I&#160;prefer the texture of all-pork or a mixture of pork and beef, but 2M's had a great flavor that allayed my concerns. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">The sides did not disappoint. I ordered the <span class="FoodName">pinto beans</span>, <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term10">chicharoni</MadCap:glossaryTerm> <span class="FoodName">macaroni and cheese</span>, and <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term8">elotes</MadCap:glossaryTerm>. They were all delicious, but the elotes really stood out. It had a smoky, creamy, and sweet taste that didn't overwhelm the rest of the meal. Elotes is a side you don't see in a lot of barbecue joints outside of South Texas, so it was nice to try something different.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ordinarily, I'd provide a picture here, but I was so hungry when I got to 2M I forgot to take a pic until halfway through the meal. The picture ended up looking like it came from a crime scene, so I will spare you. </p>

            <p>My wife and I&#160;eat quite a bit of barbecue when we're in the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term11">Hill Country</MadCap:glossaryTerm>/San Antonio area on vacation, but we both agree that we're definitely heading back to 2M Smokehouse during our next trip to the Alamo City!</p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;"> If you can get there on the first Sunday of a month, 2M&#160;offers <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term6">barbacoa</MadCap:glossaryTerm>. I have never had the chance to try it there, but I hear 2M's is legendary.</p>
