            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">My family moved to San Antonio when I was nine years old. I'm sure I had at least <em>some</em> barbecue before that, but this is the first place I can recall. Even as a kid, though, I remember it being pretty bland. Basically, what made it memorable was how unmemorable it was.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">However, my paternal grandfather, who also lived in the area at the time, LOVED&#160;this place and always wanted it whenever we had family gatherings. He smoked three packs a day, though, so&#160;I'm thinking his taste buds were blown out and not the most discerning. </p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Recommends</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Hmm... I have not tried anything from this place in at least 35 years, so I'm not sure what I can honestly recommend. If I&#160;had to go by memory, though, I'd recommend a side of <span class="FoodName">pinto beans</span>. I seem to remember enjoying them. They weren't as good as my mom's but decent enough.</p>

            <p>When I look at the Bill Miller website, which displays pictures of their food, I don't see a whole lot that looks particularly appetizing. Just saying.</p>
