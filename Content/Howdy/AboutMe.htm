        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>So, who is this lunatic that's obsessed with Texas barbecue? <span class="FoodName">Ron Gardner</span>... that guy right there!</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>So... if you had to guess by looking at that t-shirt, what do you think my all-time favorite barbecue place <em><a href="../CentralTexas/SaltLick.htm#Salt">might</a></em> be?		</p>
        <p>A little bit more about me... I&#160;live in Texas, outside of Dallas (duh; it wouldn't make a lot of sense to focus on Texas barbecue if I lived in Vermont). I&#160;have a B.S. in Agricultural Journalism from Texas A&amp;M&#160;University in College Station (trust me, it's a <a href="https://alec.tamu.edu/academics/undergraduate/agricultural-communications/" target="_blank" title="Click this link to open the Texas A&amp;M Agricultural Communications and Journalism website.">legit degree program</a>). I've been a technical writer for over 25 years, ever since I graduated from A&amp;M. I currently work as a remote technical writer for an enterprise performance management software company.</p>
        <p>I'm married to my wife,&#160;Shannon, who actively encourages and shares my barbecue obsession. She's my partner in BBQ&#160;crime!&#160;Our hobbies include traveling around Texas, watching and talking about movies, and trying new places to eat... with an emphasis on barbecue, of course!</p>
        <p>We also have 6 cats that run the house, only one of which seems to like barbecue. Don't worry, I give her only tiny pieces of brisket or turkey from time to time. I watch out for her health!</p>

        <p>If podcasts are your thing, a while back I helped a good friend with an episode of her tech writing show. I&#160;had a complete blast doing it, and I&#160;hope my enthusiasm showed! Feel free to give it a listen:</p>
