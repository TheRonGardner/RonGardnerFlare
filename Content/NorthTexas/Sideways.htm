            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">The sign on the front of this place says only "Sideways". No mention of barbecue, so go figure. Their website (listed above) indicates it is indeed a barbecue place. I'm just saying I&#160;might not have known it  had anything to do with barbecue if I strolled by the place without knowing.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">As far as my take on the food there... well... they can't all be "<a href="Winners.htm">winners</a>". I figured I should include at least one mediocre place in this project so&#160;I don't come across as a "Barbecue <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term9">Pollyanna</MadCap:glossaryTerm>". Unfortunately for Sideways, it met the low bar.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Before visiting, I had really high hopes for this place. People online talked a <em>really</em> big game about it. My meal, however, did not live up to the hype. Maybe it was just an off day for them, I don't know, but my visit didn't endear me to the place. I'll try going back again one day and give them a second chance.</p>

            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">The <span class="FoodName">pork spareribs</span>... I guess??? Honestly, I&#160;don't really remember a whole lot about this meal.</p>

            <p>Is "Meh"&#160;a rating? It really was middle of the road, so I'll split the 5 stars in half.</p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">This place is located on the shores of <a href="http://www.lake-ray-hubbard.com/" target="_blank">Lake Ray Hubbard</a>, so at least the view is kind of nice.</p>
