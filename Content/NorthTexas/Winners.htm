            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">On the outside, Winners (note the lack of apostrophe) is in an unassuming location in a strip mall. On the inside, however, the smoky, aromatic smell that greets you upon entering lets you know this place means business.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Winners has a laid-back, homey feel with a great throwback ambiance. The plastic chairs, formica tables, and old-school R&amp;B&#160;music they play reminds me of when I&#160;was a little kid in the 1970s. And I&#160;mean the good parts I&#160;remember about being a kid, such as Big Wheels and Slip 'n' Slides. Not the gas lines or Iranian hostages.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">The staff are super welcoming and friendly. If you have any questions, be it a recommendation on a meat or a side or even how much of something you should get, they are very helpful! </p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Recommends</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">If I was forced to choose just one thing on the menu at Winners, I'd totally cheat since it's a mixture of several smoked meats and go with <span class="FoodName">The GOAT</span>.  No, there isn't any actual goat meat in this. For the non-sports fans in the audience, it's an acronym for "Greatest of All Time".</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">This version of the GOAT&#160;is a massive baked potato loaded with cheddar cheese, sour cream, and the following meats:</p>
            <ul MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">
                <li>
                    <p>Chopped brisket</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Sausage</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Ribs</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Pulled pork</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Chicken</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Look at the size of this thing!&#160;It's as big as my head! </p>

                <img src="../Resources/Images/Winners2.png" class="popup" title="[%=General.ImageTip%]" />
            </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Of course, there was no way I&#160;could finish it in one sitting. I'm not one of those "<a href="https://www.travelchannel.com/shows/man-v-food-1" target="_blank" title="Click this link to view the &quot;Man v Food&quot; official website.">Man v. Food</a>" type masochists. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">The GOAT&#160;was actually pretty affordable, though, and I was able to take the remainder home. I&#160;had four days' worth of leftovers. It was TOTALLY worth it!</p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Rates It</h2>

            <p>My wife and I&#160;took some meat and sides from Winners to my mother-in-law for Mother's Day 2021. She loves barbecue as well and really enjoyed what we brought. That alone merits a high rating.</p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">   Winners is located in a mini strip mall, so it's easy to drive right past the place if you're not paying attention. You might want to map out your trip beforehand or at least have the GPS on standby.</p>
