        <p>Swung by after dropping my wife at the airport. Curious... </p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron's Review</h2>
        <p>I had the 2-meat plate with the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="FoodName">Moist brisket</span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="FoodName">Pepper jack sausage</span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="FoodName">Pinto beans</span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <p><span class="FoodName">Green chile mac and cheese</span>
                    </p>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I&#160;saw <span class="FoodName">bacon burnt ends</span> on the menu and absolutely had to try them, so I&#160;ordered a half-pound.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Meats</h3>
        <p>Bacon burnt ends were excellent and the best thing I tried this visit. In fact, I pulled a "car fries" move and snuck a couple on the way home.</p>
        <p>Brisket was good, but a large slab of meat. Pepper jack cheese sausage was very good.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Sides</h3>
        <p>The pinto beans were more like chili beans, but unlike any I ever had before. Large onion pieces that were nice. Green chile mac and cheese was creamy and had a nice peppery note.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Sauce</h3>
        <p>They didn't give me any. I don't know if that was an oversight, or if they have a Kreuz Market approach to sauce, which is none.</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Dessert</h3>
        <p>I passed on desserts, given the travel time from Love Field to McKinney, where I live. The banana pudding sounded VERY intriguing, and I&#160;will try when I&#160;return here.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Rates It</h2>
        <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">This pace is on the "Honorable Mentions" list for Texas Monthly, so I was interested. It was most definitely very good, but not mind-blowing. However, there was some travel time involved until I&#160;could enjoy the meal. That being said,&#160;I will return here to try in person and update my review.</p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">It's in a pretty busy area near a major airport, so be prepared. It's not a bad place to kill some time if you have some wiggle room before a flight and can get a ride to the airport.</p>
