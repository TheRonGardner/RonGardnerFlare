            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic"><span class="FoodName">*Update:</span>&#160;On December 16th, 2021, pitmaster John Mueller passed away at the age of 52 after a long battle with cancer. The Mueller family is Texas barbecue royalty, and its influence can be found in many barbecue joints around the state (most notably, nationally famous pitmaster <a href="../CentralTexas/FranklinBBQ.htm">Aaron Franklin</a> once worked for John Mueller). John's unpredictable nature earned him the nickname "The Dark Prince of Texas Barbecue", but his undeniable talents as a pitmaster will be missed.</p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Full disclosure... I&#160;live in McKinney, so I might come across as a bit of a <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term12">homer</MadCap:glossaryTerm> in this review. However,&#160;anyone I've introduced to either Hutchins location ABSOLUTELY&#160;loves the food, so I&#160;must be onto something.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">I first became aware of Hutchins when my wife and I moved to McKinney in late 2012. At the time, the locals knew about the place and it was a hands-down favorite. Even so, my wife and I&#160;could freely walk in the place on the weekends without a wait.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">However, in 2013, Hutchins earned a coveted place on the influential <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/food/the-list-the-top-50-barbecue-joints-in-texas/" target="_blank" title="Click this link to view the list.">"The Top 50 Barbecue Joints in Texas"</a> list (which is updated every four years, and Hutchins remained on the subsequent 2017 and 2021 lists). Now the customer lines are out the door every day of the week.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">I frequent both the original McKinney location, near my home, and the satellite location in Frisco, near where I work. I have NEVER&#160;had a bad meal at either location.</p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Recommends</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">All the meats at Hutchins are utterly fantastic, but definitely try the brisket <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term1">burnt ends</MadCap:glossaryTerm> or the  INCREDIBLE&#160;<span class="FoodName">jalapeno cheddar pork sausage</span>. These are both on my lists of <a href="../MoreInfo/Top3s.htm">"Top 3"&#160;barbecue items</a>. You should also try the delicious sides, most notably the <span class="FoodName">brisket pinto beans</span> or <span class="FoodName">broccoli salad</span>. I&#160;know... <em>"Broccoli salad at a barbecue joint???"</em> Trust me, it's really good!</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Hutchins also offers a specialty item called a <span class="FoodName">Texas Twinkie</span>. It's a large cored and seeded jalapeño pepper stuffed with smoked brisket and cream cheese and then wrapped in peppered bacon, basted in sauce, and thrown on the smoker. It is sheer bliss!</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Here's a pic of a plate I got during a trip to Hutchins a few years ago. Notice that the Texas Twinkie in the lower part of the pic is cut in half. A good friend of mine had never tried one before, so I HAD&#160;to share! He agreed that it was pretty amazing and orders one every time he can.</p>

            <p>Hutchins Barbecue is one of my favorite barbecue places in the entire state of Texas, so I have to give it the full five stars.</p>
        </MadCap:microContent>
        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">   The McKinney location has a drive-thru window, so if you don't feel like dining inside, this is a great option.</p>
