        <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">I&#160;don't have any pictures to share. After I sit down, I tear into the food immediately like a starving jackal. That's how stoked I am to dig into a plate of Cattleack when I sit down. </p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:conditions="Default.InternalOnly" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">It has been my experience that Todd, the pitmaster, can get a bit irritated if you dawdle when ordering (ala a certain <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAmaJkME2m4" target="_blank">"Seinfeld"&#160;character</a>), although he would never rescind your order. While you're in line, it's a good idea to review the menus on the wall so you know what you want when you step up to order. Don't hold it against Todd, though. He just wants to keep the deservedly long line moving. Todd's wife, Misty, runs the cash register and is legit one of the nicest people on the planet, so it evens itself out.</p>
