                <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Certification">Why am I doing this project?&#160;Because I want to get certified "MAD&#160;for Flare!"&#160;</p>
                <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Certification">l kicked around MANY ideas in my head about what I could do for a project, and I&#160;kept coming up blank. Then it hit me...  what is the one thing anyone who knows me says I can talk a LOT&#160;about?&#160;Texas barbecue! </p>
                <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Certification">I&#160;had a lot of fun creating this project. I&#160;hope you enjoy the ride!</p>
                <p MadCap:conditions="Default.BlogOnly">Hi there, thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoy my reviews of the different barbecue joints I've visited around Texas. Over the past couple of decades, I've made my way around many different areas of the state and tried all kinds of barbecue. Some was good, some was "meh", and some rank with the best meals I've ever had. I figured a website was a good way to collect my thoughts about each place.</p>
                <p MadCap:conditions="Default.BlogOnly">Full disclosure... I'm not getting paid for this, it's merely a labor of love. No sponsors are overtly influencing things, and I&#160;have no preconceived notions getting in the way. This is just an unbiased collection <span class="FoodName">of my opinions</span> about some of the barbecue places I've tried around Texas.</p>
                <p MadCap:conditions="Default.BlogOnly">This is a continual work in progress, and I will add reviews as I visit new places or update old reviews after a re-visit.</p>
                <p class="note" MadCap:conditions="Default.WebOnly" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">Apologies to the good people of West Texas and The Panhandle, but it's a haul to get out that way from the Dallas area. I&#160;have not had a chance to sample any of your tasty barbecue, hence the omission of both regions on the top navigation menu. Maybe one day I&#160;can make it out there, try some places, and fill in those gaps!</p>
