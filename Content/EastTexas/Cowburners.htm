        <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
        <p>My wife and I&#160;head to northeastern Texas several times throughout the year. Sometimes we head down Interstate 20, sometimes down US Highway 80. A while back, we discovered CowBurners in the small town of Mineola. We stopped by on a lark and did not regret the decision at all. It's on our agenda to stop by whenever we are anywhere near Mineola.</p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron's Review (12/29/22)</h2>
        <p>During my most recent visit, my wife had the <span class="FoodName">BBQ&#160;Frito Pie</span> with a side of <span class="FoodName">Hatch green chile mac and cheese</span>. I tried some of the Frito pie, and it was amazing! I'd rank it close to one of my favorite barbecue Frito pies, the one from <MadCap:xref href="Stanleys.htm"> Stanley's Famous Pit BBQ</MadCap:xref> in Tyler.</p>
        <p>I&#160;had the two-meat plate with the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term7">Moist brisket</MadCap:glossaryTerm>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="FoodName">Pepper Jack pork sausage</span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="FoodName">Pinto beans</span>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="FoodName">Hatch green chile mac and cheese</span>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Meats</h3>
        <p>The moist brisket was excellent</p>
        <p>Pepper jack sausage</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Sides</h3>
        <p>The pinto beans were... decent. I&#160;recall them being better during previous visits. Full disclosure, I&#160;grew up eating my mom's phenomenal pinto beans, so I&#160;am admittedly hyper-critical when it comes to my pintos. The beans I&#160;tried this time weren't seasoned much and were almost al dente. Perhaps that was by design to offset the beans offered in the Frito pie. That being said, I will try them again the next time I return and offer a second opinion.</p>
        <p>The Hatch chile mac and cheese, however... yeah! It was most definitely the better of the two sides I tried. It was made with cavatappi pasta and not the usual elbow macaroni. The sauce was creamy and smooth, with the bacon and Hatch green chiles providing a great complement. </p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Sauce</h3>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h3 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Dessert</h3>
        <p>We did not try the dessert. Maybe next time! </p>
        <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Rates It</h2>
        <p>When we travel down 80 and feel like stopping in Mineola, a trip to CowBurners is always on the agenda. </p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">Mineola is still a pretty small town, so CowBurners isn't terribly large on the inside. If you show up later in the day, it might be dodgy to get a table. You might want to arrive early. On the flip side, CowBurners is also a taproom, so you could nab a beer at the bar if you have to wait for a table.</p>
