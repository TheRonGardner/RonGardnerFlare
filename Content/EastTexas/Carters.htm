            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">My wife stumbled across this place in East Texas via an online search of good places to eat in the area. We travel that way quite often from the Dallas area, so we are always looking for new places to try. Carter's came highly recommended, so we gave it a shot. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">It's is a pretty unassuming place with not a lot of "hooptedoodle" (to borrow from John Steinbeck). It's a converted convenience store/gas station, so it doesn't have a lot of the usual hallmarks of a typical barbecue joint. Aside from the sign out front, the only other thing indicating it has anything to do with barbecue is the stacks of hickory wood out front. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Carter's is a pretty small place and does not have a lot of inside seating. I think it focuses mainly on take-out and seems to be doing rather well with that. However, it also has a drive-thru, which I really appreciate. Sometimes, you want to pick up some food in your car and keep soldiering on to your destination. However, what we ordered smelled so good we had to pull over and try it right in the parking lot. We were NOT disappointed!</p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Recommends</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Try the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term4">boudain</MadCap:glossaryTerm> (pronounced "boo-dan" and usually spelled "boudin") and <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term2">hot links</MadCap:glossaryTerm>. You might think getting two types of sausage is overkill, but both are utterly fantastic.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">About the "boudain" at Carter's ... it's definitely a different consistency than traditional sausage. You might think rice and ground pork stuffed into a natural casing might be weird, but you should try it if you ever get the chance. Wow, it's good, and might just be one of my <a href="../MoreInfo/Top3s.htm">favorite sausages ever</a>!</p>

            <p>Carter's is on my "must visit" list every time I'm in Longview.</p>
        </MadCap:microContent>
        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;"> Carter's has a drive-thru option, but there can be quite the wait to get through it. On my last visit, it was probably a 45-minute wait. </p>
