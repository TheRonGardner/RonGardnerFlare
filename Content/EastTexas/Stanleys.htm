            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">My wife and I&#160;have been going to Stanley's for years, every time we're in the Tyler area. It used to be a lot smaller, but it has grown both in size and popularity since it made Texas Monthly Magazine's "<a href="[%=General.Top 50 Link%]" target="_blank" title="Click this link to open Texas Monthly's &quot;Top 50 Barbecue Joints&quot; list.">Top 50 Barbecue Joints in Texas</a>"&#160;list back in 2008. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Seating used to be rather dodgy, due to the previously tiny dining area, but Nick, the owner and pitmaster, has greatly expanded the place. Stanley's now has an expansive patio that includes a bar and a stage where live bands can play. </p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Recommends</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">My favorite thing on Stanley's menu is the <span class="FoodName">Barbecue Frito Pie</span>. It's a pretty simple setup of one or more meats of your choosing, cheddar cheese, pinto beans, onions, and barbecue sauce  atop a layer of Fritos® corn chips. You can also add sour cream on top if that's your thing. </p>

            </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic"> It might just be one of the worst things on the planet for you, but it is soooo good!</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">However, if you don't find Fritos in your barbecue appealing (no judgment here), Stanley's also has a phenomenal sandwich called <span class="FoodName">The Brother-in-Law</span>. It contains a <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term0">butterflied</MadCap:glossaryTerm> grilled hot link, cheese, chopped brisket, and sauce. I&#160;highly recommend getting it with a jalapeno cheese sourdough bun. It's probably my favorite barbecue sandwich EVAH.</p>

            </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Stanley's is also quite well-known for their <span class="FoodName">baby back ribs</span>. They've won several statewide barbecue competitions with them. I've had them on multiple occasions and they are some of my favorite pork ribs ever.</p>

            <p>Any time I'm in Tyler, a trip to Stanley's is definitely on the agenda!</p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;"> Parking can be extremely dodgy and the line to get into the place can get rather long, so arrive early if you can. You can try an off hour, such as 3:00 in the afternoon, but some items might be sold out by that time.</p>
