            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Because I have family ties to the area, my wife and I&#160;frequently travel to the northeastern corner of Texas. We've stumbled across <em>many</em> great barbecue locations in our travels that direction, and we are adding Brisket Love to the list. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Late summer of 2022, we visited an antique store in Lindale that had been on my wife's radar for some time. Since we were in the area, we decided to check out Brisket Love. I was a little hesitant because we had gorged out on <a href="../NorthTexas/Hutchins.htm">Hutchins Barbecue</a> the previous weekend and wasn’t sure I wanted barbecue again so soon.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">I'm glad we made that call, because it was <em>really</em> good! Brisket Love serves not only great barbecue, but fantastic hamburgers as well. Just so you get a feel for what they have, here's the menu the day we visited:</p>

            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron's Review</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">My wife had the Stanley Williams burger (not listed on the preceding menu picture) sans the egg. She shared it with me, and it was SO FREAKING GOOD. Definitely one of the better burgers I've ever had. We agreed that whenever we make it back to Brisket Love, one of us is definitely getting a burger.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">However, this is a barbecue review site, so I'll stick with the 'cue review. I tried the two-meat plate with the following:</p>
            <ul MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">
                <li>
                    <p><span class="FoodName"><MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term7">Moist brisket</MadCap:glossaryTerm></span> </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><span class="FoodName">Hatch green chile sausage</span> </p>
                </li>

                    </p>

                    <p><span class="FoodName">Bacon mac and cheese</span>
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Meats</h3>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">The meats were excellent and definitely stood out. The brisket had the right amount of seasoning and smoke, creating a nice bark and pronounced smoke ring. The sausage was very tasty, the hatch green chiles not overwhelming the overall taste. Plus, it had a coarse grind, making it more like the traditional <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term2">hot links</MadCap:glossaryTerm> I'm familiar with and love.</p>
            <h3 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Sides</h3>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">The sides were not quite on the same level as the meats, but were still very good. The pinto beans were more like chili beans than the baked beans you get in a lot of barbecue joints. They were smoky with a nice hint of cumin. The mac and cheese, made with pasta shells instead of the usual elbow macaroni, had a nice al dente bite, which I liked. The cheese sauce had a creamy consistency that went well with the toppings of bacon chunks and melted cheese (which I&#160;assume was cheddar). It was my favorite of the two sides.</p>
            <h3 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Sauce</h3>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">The tomato-based sauce had a slightly gritty texture due to the generous amount of black pepper mixed in. It was definitely peppery, but not overwhelmingly so. It was also slightly sweet with a hint of vinegar. Definitely a stand-out sauce, and I'll buy a bottle during my next visit!&#160;</p>
            <h3 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Dessert</h3>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">We did not have a cooler handy, so we didn't opt for dessert. The cake slices in the cooler near the cash register, however, looked extremely tempting. Maybe next time!&#160;</p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Rates It</h2>
            <p>Definitely worth the visit if you are ever in Lindale!&#160;</p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">Brisket Love is located on a curve on a two-lane state highway, so it's very easy to drive right past when you first visit. Trust me, I did just that. You might want to have the GPS ready. </p>
