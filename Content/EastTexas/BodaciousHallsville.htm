            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Bodacious is a mini-chain with locations throughout East Texas. However, the pitmaster at each franchise is given leeway to create his or her own menu items beyond the standard <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term14">"Texas Trinity"</MadCap:glossaryTerm>. This allows each pitmaster to serve up some truly great creations. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">My wife and I&#160;discovered the Hallsville location on a trip to the nearby town of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jefferson,+TX+75657/@32.767694,-94.3924315,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x8636890790c858ef:0xd174391d15e81c64!8m2!3d32.7573626!4d-94.3451926" target="_blank" title="[%=General.Location%]">Jefferson</a>. On its Facebook page, this Bodacious location posted about making smoked <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term4">boudin</MadCap:glossaryTerm>, which is an item my wife and I both really love. We had to try the place and we were NOT disappointed! </p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Recommends</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Our first trip to this Bodacious location was everything we hoped for (and more), so  we return any time we're in the area. During our first visit, we learned agave glazed bacon <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term1">burnt ends</MadCap:glossaryTerm> were available. Highly intrigued, we bought their last pound. Luck was truly on our side this trip. I&#160;was blown away at these incredibly delicious, sweet, smoky pork cubes. They might have been one of the best barbecue items - no, one of the best <em>things</em> - I have EVER&#160;eaten!!!</p>

            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">We make a point to visit the Hallsville Bodacious location whenever we are in the area. We also make sure to get at least a half rack of pork spareribs to take with us. The ribs are a touch spicy, but sooooo good and tender! </p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Rates It</h2>
            <p>Some Bodacious locations get a bad rap, but the Hallsville location is <em>definitely</em> worth the visit. There is a reason it made the "Honorable Mention"&#160;section of the 2021 version of the coveted Texas Monthly list of "<a href="[%=General.Top 50 Link%]" target="_blank">Top 50 Barbecue Joints in TX</a>".&#160;It is definitely one of the best barbecue places I've tried in East Texas!!!</p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">This Bodacious location is located at the bottom of a hill on the side of a state highway. It is super easy to drive right past if you're not paying attention. Also, given the speed of the traffic going by, it can be dodgy getting there. Plan ahead and have the  GPS on standby.</p>
