            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">My wife and I love to vacation on Galveston Island, which is south of Houston and roughly just over a five-hour drive from our house north of Dallas. I&#160;don't do well with car trips longer than three hours, so I like to break up trips that way with multiple stops during the journey. We stumbled across some pretty great places because of that, and Pinkerton's was no exception.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">In 2018, during a late summer trip to Galveston, I talked my wife into making a stop at Pinkerton's. At the time,&#160;I&#160;was fixated on visiting as many joints as I could on Texas Monthly Magazine's "<a href="[%=General.Top 50 Link%]" target="_blank">Top 50 Barbecue Joints in Texas</a>" list (<a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/food/the-list-the-top-50-barbecue-joints-in-texas/" target="_blank" title="Click this link to open the 2017 version of the &quot;Texas Monthly's Top 50 BBQ&quot; list/.">the 2017 version</a>, not the current list updated in 2025). I think my wife was just humoring me, but as soon as she saw smoked <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term4">boudin</MadCap:glossaryTerm> on the menu, she was in. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">You order "<MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term3">off the pit</MadCap:glossaryTerm>" here, which, if you're not careful, means you can end up with way more food than you intend. However, the food looked and smelled too tasty not to try multiple things on the menu, so we loaded up:</p>

            </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">No way we could eat all that in one setting. I was glad we brought a cooler 
to take the leftovers to Galveston with us!
</p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Recommends</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic"><span class="FoodName">Beef ribs</span> were available the day we visited, so I had to go for it, even though I&#160;had already ordered <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term7">moist brisket</MadCap:glossaryTerm>. Both were delicious and had great <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term5">smoke rings</MadCap:glossaryTerm>. The aforementioned smoked <span class="FoodName">boudin</span> link was fantastic and something I look forward to trying again whenever I get back to Pinkerton's. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">The sides were also great.&#160;We tried the <span class="FoodName">macaroni and cheese</span>, <span class="FoodName">pinto beans</span>, and <span class="FoodName">jalapeno cheese rice</span>. They did not disappoint!</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Even as stuffed as we were near the end of the meal, we also tried the  <span class="FoodName">banana cake</span> for dessert. It was one of the best barbecue joint desserts I've ever had! Unfortunately, Pinkerton's no longer provides banana cake, but I&#160;am <em>very</em> intrigued to try the Bananas Foster Pudding during my next visit.<br /></p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Rates It</h2>

We will definitely return to Pinkerton's SOON! </p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">In addition to its indoor seating, Pinkerton's has several outdoor picnic tables. If you can nab one on a pleasant day, it's not a bad way to spend some time while enjoying some fantastic 'cue.</p>
