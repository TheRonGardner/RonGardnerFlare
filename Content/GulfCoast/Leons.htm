            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Overview</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">My wife and I&#160;visited Leon's during a trip to Galveston in 2016. We needed a break from the excellent but abundant seafood restaurants in the area. I&#160;suggested Leon's, which at the time was on  Texas Monthly Magazine’s "<a href="[%=General.Top 50 Link%]" target="_blank">Top 50 Barbecue Joints in Texas</a>"&#160;list. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">We got there when they opened for the day, around 10 AM. This is an unusual opening time for a barbecue joint; most places tend to open closer to lunchtime. That did not deter us at all, and the crew at Leon's was ready and greeted and served us quickly. </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Mr. Leon has been cooking barbecue professionally for over 35 yeas now. He's gotten so good at it, he's been given the nickname "Dr BBQ". I think he's earned it!</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">About that "In and Out" part of the name... to quote Mr. Leon himself:</p>
            <div MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic" class="indent"><em>"You can eat it in or take it out."	</em>
            </div>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Either way, you're going to have a great meal!</p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Recommends</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">I had the  <span class="FoodName">"Leon's Cut" brisket</span>, which is cut from the fattier "point" section of the brisket. It was super tender, smoky, and delicious. The <span class="FoodName">Homemade Downtown Link</span> was a coarsely ground beef sausage that's akin to the <MadCap:glossaryTerm glossTerm="Glossary.Term2">hot links</MadCap:glossaryTerm> that are common in East Texas. It had a consistency more like meatloaf than sausage, but I liked it quite a bit. It was greasy and savory, and I mean that in the best way.</p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Leon's sides are more like traditional old school Southern cooking than what is usually served with Texas barbecue. I'm not generally a fan of greens, but Leon's <span class="FoodName">turnip greens</span> had a good flavor that wasn't as bitter as most greens I've tried. The <span class="FoodName">spicy rice</span>, containing bits of celery and jalapeno, and the sweet and smoky <span class="FoodName">BBQ beans</span> were excellent complements to the meal.</p>

            </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">For dessert, I tried the <span class="FoodName">sweet potato pie</span>. It was sweet and creamy and had a light, flaky crust. It was fantastic! </p>

            <p>There is so much amazing food in Galveston, most of it seafood, but my wife and I&#160;will always find time for Leon's!</p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">  If you get the chance to talk to Mr. Leon himself, by all means do so. He loves what he does and it shows in his food and his genuinely appreciative interactions with his customers.</p>
