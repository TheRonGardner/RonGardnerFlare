            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Okay, this is another place that - like my beloved <MadCap:xref href="../CentralTexas/GristMill.htm">Grist Mill River Restaurant and Bar</MadCap:xref> - isn't <em>technically</em> a barbecue place (hence no mention of a pitmaster above), but it serves a unique barbecue&#160;item with a seafood slant: &#160;"barbecue" crabs.</p>

            </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Stingaree's version of involves a few steps, none of which involve a traditional smoker:</p>
            <ol>
                <li MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Boil the crabs.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Dip them in barbecue seasoning.</li>
                <li MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Broil them. </li>
            </ol>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Granted, it's not <em>actually</em> barbecue, but I'll allow it. They are that tasty!</p>
            <h2 MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">Ron Recommends</h2>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">If you're at Stingaree, you can't go wrong with a big, heaping plate of those <span class="FoodName">barbecue crabs</span>, of course! </p>
            <p MadCap:conditions="MicroContent.Topic">However, if you're not up for the considerable work (and mess)&#160;of eating crab, a great alternative is a plate of their awesome <span class="FoodName">jerk shrimp skewers</span>. </p>

            <p>Yeah, yeah, I know: "That's not really barbecue!" Skip Stingaree Restaurant and Marina to your detriment.</p>

        <p class="know" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Know Before You Go: &lt;/b&gt;">If you're coming from Galveston (as we did), getting to Stingaree takes some effort. You have to take the free-of-charge&#160;ferry to get there, which is about a 20-25 minute trip but a cool experience. Then you have to drive to the middle of Bolivar Peninsula, so there is some effort. From the Galveston ferry terminal, it's roughly 45 minutes one way. Also, Stingaree is closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, so definitely plan ahead.</p>
