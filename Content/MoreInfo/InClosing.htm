        <h1>In Closing</h1>
        <p MadCap:conditions="Default.Certification">This project has been a ton of fun and I hope to keep it going well after I get Flare certified (fingers crossed).</p>
        <p>I really hope you enjoyed this tour of some of my favorite barbecue joints in Texas. I have lots more places to visit and reviews to write, so come back soon.</p>
        <p>Happy 'cue, y'all!</p>
