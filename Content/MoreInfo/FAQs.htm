        <p>I get a LOT of questions about my barbecue travels. Here are the ones I get the most often (click the plus icon to view the answer):</p>

                <p>Funny, but I didn't always have the barbecue bug. I would eat it from time to time growing up, but I never had really GREAT&#160;barbecue until well into my adulthood. Honestly, I think it was my first trip to the Driftwood location of <a href="../CentralTexas/SaltLick.htm" target="_blank">The Salt Lick</a> in 2006 that really got me started.</p>
                <p>Plus, I&#160;really like the simplicity of it all:&#160;fire, smoke, and meat. There are so many creative pitmasters out there making fantastic barbecue from these simple beginnings and putting their own spin on things. It's fun to try unique menu items from various places.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Do you make you own barbecue?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Oh no no no. And no. I&#160;have friends that smoke their own meats and do <em>amazing</em> jobs, but I haven't acquired those skills yet. Right now, I&#160;prefer to leave this to the professionals and semi-professionals and enjoy the fruits of their labors.</p>
                <p>That being said, I might need a hobby years down the road when I retire. Why not take up the mantle of novice pitmaster?</p>

                <p>Ho boy, have I&#160;ever! However, in spite of all the places I've visited and the odds that it would be, it wasn't in Texas. It was somewhere in Louisiana, on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain across from New Orleans. Neither my wife nor I could finish our plates. Next time we're in the NOLA&#160;area, we'll stick with gumbo, seafood, or po boys.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>What is your all-time FAVORITE&#160;barbecue place?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>This is a SUPER&#160;tough question for me to answer. I love so many places, and each place has at least one menu item that really appeals to me, be it some type of meat, a fantastic side, or an incredible dessert. One place could have great brisket while another could have amazing ribs, while another could have just a simple side dish or dessert that really impresses me. </p>
                <p>If I'm answering solely based on the quality of the food, I'd say <a href="../NorthTexas/Hutchins.htm">Hutchins Barbecue</a> in  McKinney, north of Dallas. From meat to sides, I've <em>never</em> had a bad meal there.</p>
                <p>For an overall barbecue experience, though, and I know I keep mentioning this place, I have to go with <a href="../CentralTexas/SaltLick.htm">The Salt Lick</a> in Driftwood, southwest of Austin. This place has all the hallmarks of a great barbecue joint:&#160;an out-of-the-way location; the smoky perfume of meat and live oak wood as you approach the place; the open pit you see right when you walk in the door. It just has an old school feel that I&#160;really like. Plus, in the parking lot, they have a life-sized replica of the TARDIS&#160;from "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who" target="_blank" title="Click this link to open the pretty expansive Wikipedia page for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.">Doctor Who</a>" that really appeals to my inner fanboy.</p>

        <p>And, finally, here's the question I get asked the most...</p>
        <MadCap:dropDown>
            <MadCap:dropDownHead>
                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Sauce or no sauce?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Honestly, I'm not a big sauce person. If&#160;the meat is seasoned and smoked correctly, you don't <em>really</em> need sauce. In fact, I've been to some places in Central Texas that flat-out refuse to provide sauce. To this day, my wife stills holds a grudge against <a href="https://kreuzmarket.com/" target="_blank">Kreuz Market</a> in Lockhart because they do not serve sauce. At all.</p>
                <p>That being said, if a joint has good sauce, I don't mind a little on the side as a complement to the meat. In fact, some of my favorite places are now bottling their sauces for broader consumption (e.g., <a href="https://www.stanleysfamous.com/catalog/product/stanleys-famous-sauce-rubs/stanleys-famous-bbq-sauce/" target="_blank" title="Click this link to open the online store for Stanley's Famous Pit BBQ.">Stanley's</a>). I&#160;have a some bottles in my fridge from different places I've visited. I'll break them out from time to time, depending on what I'm eating.</p>
