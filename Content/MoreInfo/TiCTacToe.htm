        <h1>How to Play Tic-Tac-Toe for Two Players</h1>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>These instructions explain how to play the pen-and-paper version of tic-tac-toe using two human players.</p>
        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>Before you can begin playing, you need the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two human players</li>
            <li>A pen or a pencil</li>
            <li>A sheet of paper</li>
            <li>A level playing surface on which you can draw</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The first player to draw a continuous line of 3 Xs or Os in the grid (connected vertically, horizontally, or vertically) wins.</p>
        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using the pen or pencil, draw a 3 x 3 grid (3 rows, 3 columns) on the piece of paper. The grid should resemble a hashtag (#).</li>
            <li>Determine who goes first. Player One will play Xs, and Player Two will plays Os.</li>
            <li>Player One is not required to play Xs, but these instructions consider this a best practice.</li>
            <li>Player One, draw an X in any of the empty squares in the grid.</li>
            <li>Player Two, draw an O in any of the remaining empty squares in the grid.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 3 and 4 until one of the following happens:<ul><li>Either of the players draws connects three of his or her symbols (vertically, horizontally, diagonally)</li><li>All nine grid squares are filled and neither player has 3 in a line</li></ul></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>The tips in this section can help you become a better Tic Tac Toe player.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you can, put your symbol in the center square. This gives you the best chance for connecting 3 of your symbols in a line.</li>
            <li>If the other player puts a symbol in the center square, put your symbol in one of the corner squares. This gives you the best chance of connecting 3 of your symbols without going through the center square.</li>
            <li>If you can't connect 3 of your symbols in a line, try to prevent your opponent from doing so. If you can't win, there is no shame in playing defense.</li>
        </ul>
