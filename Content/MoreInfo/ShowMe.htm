        <h1>"Show Me"&#160;Videos</h1>
        <p>The videos on this page are intended to complement written instructions and provide a visual representation of the way a process works. These "Show Me" videos are no longer than 30 seconds and were created  using TechSmith&#160;Camtasia.</p>
        <p class="note" MadCap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">The information in these videos were created in clean environments using manufactured data and do not contain personal data.</p>
        <p><span class="FoodName">Animated GIFs</span>
        </p>
        <p>These videos were intended to play in Internet Explorer 11, which did not support MP4 files. To address this issue, these videos were created as animated GIF files. Because the GIFs do not have a playback bar, they were designed to  play on a loop.</p>

        <p><span class="FoodName">MP4s</span>
        </p>
        <p>After the Internet Explorer 11 restriction was lifted and my clients started using Chromium-based browsers, I&#160;was able to create and implement MP4 video files. These videos have a playback bar, which allows the viewer to pause, skip forward and back through the playback bar, and maximize the videos.</p>
